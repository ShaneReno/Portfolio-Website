HTML and CSS webpage detailing my skills

Portfolio-Website
A Portfolio 'About Me' Website.

This personal website was constructed using HTML, CSS and relevant web design practices. The design features modern and neat stylising with bright complementary colours. The purpose of the website is to display some of my technical skills in a simplistic yet professional manner, whilst showcasing intrinsic web development practices. The site is essentially a successor to my previous and outdated HTML based 'CV' project.
